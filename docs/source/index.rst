Welcome to our team's documentation!
===================================

**Our teams documentation** is a library for our team to refer to and update, as necessary.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Lumache has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
